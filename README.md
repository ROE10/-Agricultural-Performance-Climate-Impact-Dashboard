# 🌾 Agricultural Performance & Climate Impact Analysis  
### Data-Driven Insights from the Maji Ndogo Dataset

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between environmental conditions and agricultural productivity using the **Maji Ndogo agricultural dataset**.

The analysis investigates how climate and environmental variables such as rainfall, temperature range, elevation, soil pH, pollution levels, and plot size influence annual crop yield across different crop types.

The project combines Python-based statistical analysis with an interactive Power BI dashboard to transform raw agricultural data into actionable insights.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyse environmental drivers of crop productivity  
- Identify yield distribution patterns across crop types  
- Compare average yield between selected crops using statistical testing  
- Visualise climate–yield relationships  
- Develop an interactive dashboard for strategic decision-making
